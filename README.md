### 개요
The main purpose of this work is to innovate and improve the way young children are taught English using augmented reality (AR) technology. We focus on overcoming the limitations of the current early childhood education method, helping children learn English more naturally and effectively, and developing language skills that can be applied in real-life situations. Using AR to provide children with a richer, more interactive and personalized English learning experience

### 앱 소개
I developed it as an iPad-exclusive application, considering the use of AR and its usage by young children. The interface is composed of large and intuitive designs, making it easily accessible for young users. Additionally, the goal is to maximize learning effectiveness by stimulating children's senses, and it includes fun visual and auditory elements centered around animal characters from fairy tales.
